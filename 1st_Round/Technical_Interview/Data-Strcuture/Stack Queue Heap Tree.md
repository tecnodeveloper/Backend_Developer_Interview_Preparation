# Stack, Queue, Heap, and Tree in C++ (OOP Perspective)

---

# 1. Stack

---

## 1.1 Definition

A **Stack** is a linear data structure that follows:

> **LIFO (Last In, First Out)**

The last element added is the first one removed.

---

## 1.2 Why Stack Exists

- Needed for **reversing operations**
    
- Used in **function calls (call stack)**
    
- Helps in **undo/redo systems**
    

---

## 1.3 Mental Model

Think of a **stack of books**:

- Add on top
    
- Remove from top
    

---

## 1.4 Syntax (Concept in JS Style)

```javascript
class Stack {
  constructor() {
    this.items = [];
  }

  push(x) {
    this.items.push(x);
  }

  pop() {
    return this.items.pop();
  }

  peek() {
    return this.items[this.items.length - 1];
  }
}
```

---

## 1.5 Basic Example

```javascript
const s = new Stack();

s.push(10);
s.push(20);
s.push(30);

console.log(s.pop()); // 30
```

---

## 1.6 Step-by-Step

```text
Push 10 → [10]
Push 20 → [10,20]
Push 30 → [10,20,30]

Pop → 30 removed
```

---

## 1.7 Real-World Use Case

- Browser back button
    
- Undo feature
    

---

## 1.8 Common Mistakes

❌ Popping empty stack  
✔ Always check before pop

---

## 1.9 Key Points

- LIFO
    
- Fast operations (O(1))
    
- Only top accessible
    

---

---

# 2. Queue

---

## 2.1 Definition

A **Queue** follows:

> **FIFO (First In, First Out)**

First inserted element is removed first.

---

## 2.2 Why Queue Exists

- Fair processing
    
- Task scheduling
    
- Request handling
    

---

## 2.3 Mental Model

Think of a **line at a shop**:

- First person served first
    

---

## 2.4 Syntax

```javascript
class Queue {
  constructor() {
    this.items = [];
  }

  enqueue(x) {
    this.items.push(x);
  }

  dequeue() {
    return this.items.shift();
  }
}
```

---

## 2.5 Example

```javascript
const q = new Queue();

q.enqueue("A");
q.enqueue("B");

console.log(q.dequeue()); // A
```

---

## 2.6 Step-by-Step

```text
[A]
[A,B]

Dequeue → removes A
```

---

## 2.7 Real-World Use

- API request queue
    
- CPU scheduling
    

---

## 2.8 Common Mistakes

❌ Using pop instead of shift  
✔ Always remove from front

---

## 2.9 Key Points

- FIFO
    
- Used in scheduling
    
- Order matters
    

---

---

# 3. Heap

---

## 3.1 Definition

A **Heap** is a special tree structure where:

- **Min Heap** → smallest at root
    
- **Max Heap** → largest at root
    

---

## 3.2 Why Heap Exists

- Efficient priority access
    
- Used in algorithms like shortest path
    

---

## 3.3 Mental Model

Think of a **priority system**:

- Highest priority comes first
    

---

## 3.4 Syntax

```javascript
class MinHeap {
  constructor() {
    this.heap = [];
  }

  insert(val) {
    this.heap.push(val);
    this.heap.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  }

  extractMin() {
    return this.heap.shift();
  }
}
```

---

## 3.5 Example

```javascript
const h = new MinHeap();

h.insert(5);
h.insert(2);
h.insert(8);

console.log(h.extractMin()); // 2
```

---

## 3.6 Step-by-Step

```text
Insert 5 → [5]
Insert 2 → [2,5]
Insert 8 → [2,5,8]

Extract → 2
```

---

## 3.7 Real-World Use

- Task priority systems
    
- Dijkstra algorithm
    

---

## 3.8 Common Mistakes

❌ Assuming heap is sorted  
✔ Only root is guaranteed min/max

---

## 3.9 Key Points

- Complete binary tree
    
- Fast min/max access
    
- Not fully sorted
    

---

---

# 4. Tree

---

## 4.1 Definition

A **Tree** is a hierarchical structure of nodes with:

- One root
    
- Parent-child relationships
    

---

## 4.2 Why Tree Exists

- Represent hierarchical data
    
- Efficient searching (BST)
    

---

## 4.3 Mental Model

Think of a **family tree**:

- Root → ancestor
    
- Children → descendants
    

---

## 4.4 Syntax

```javascript
class TreeNode {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.left = null;
    this.right = null;
  }
}
```

---

## 4.5 Basic Example (Binary Tree)

```javascript
const root = new TreeNode(10);
root.left = new TreeNode(5);
root.right = new TreeNode(15);
```

---

## 4.6 Traversal (DFS)

```javascript
function inorder(node) {
  if (!node) return;

  inorder(node.left);
  console.log(node.data);
  inorder(node.right);
}
```

---

## 4.7 Step-by-Step

```text
    10
   /  \
  5   15

Inorder → 5, 10, 15
```

---

## 4.8 Real-World Use

- File systems
    
- Database indexing
    

---

## 4.9 Common Mistakes

❌ Ignoring null checks  
✔ Always check node existence

---

## 4.10 Key Points

- Hierarchical
    
- No cycles
    
- Recursive structure
    

---

---
